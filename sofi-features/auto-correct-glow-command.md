# Auto-Correct Glow Command

the "Auto-Correct Glow Command" is a feature that automatically adjusts or corrects the formatting of glow commands within the game. When you enter a glow command with multiple values separated by commas, the bot automatically removes the extra commas, ensuring that the command is correctly formatted and can be processed by the game system without errors.

### For example

Your Input:

sglo nmiost #n1n7gf , #kjesbu , #jabbku , #17a9au , #viw25e , #y1e9ct

Bot-corrected output:&#x20;

sglo nmiost #n1n7gf #kjesbu #jabbku #17a9au #viw25e #y1e9ct
