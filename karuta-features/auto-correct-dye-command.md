# Auto-Correct Dye Command

the "Auto-Correct Dye Command" is a feature that automatically adjusts or corrects the formatting of dye commands within the game. When you enter a dye command with multiple values separated by commas, the bot automatically removes the extra commas, ensuring that the command is correctly formatted and can be processed by the game system without errors.

### For example

Your Input:

kdye 397nff $t8w0q, $dlhh2, $785nd, $dfv6d, $d3k4q, $dqf31, $dftmw, $d86w9, $dflzn, $d32xl, $dbw3f, $7g0cz, $dfdfv, $dljpc, $7tf72, $4czj3, $fm3wr, $0mwd9, $nkfq4, $7s7j8, $0mwd9

Bot-corrected output:&#x20;

kdye 397nff $t8w0q $dlhh2 $785nd $dfv6d $d3k4q $dqf31 $dftmw $d86w9 $dflzn $d32xl $dbw3f $7g0cz $dfdfv $dljpc $7tf72 $4czj3 $fm3wr $0mwd9 $nkfq4 $7s7j8 $0mwd9
